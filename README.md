# NEAT Reinforcement Learning with OpenAI Gym
Testing the implementation of the NEAT algorithm (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) on some [OpenAI gym](https://gym.openai.com/) environments

The example is one of the simplest possible implementation using the [neat-python](https://github.com/CodeReclaimers/neat-python) library and the BipedalWalker-v2 environment.

Can be run by simply typing 
```python
python run_this.py
```
